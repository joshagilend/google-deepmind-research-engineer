### I've been building with AI before AI was cool :)

In 2016, I started a company with a contact from the Transformative Technology Lab in Palo Alto. The company has raised over 20M since then.

In 2013, I published a paper with an AI PhD student and his research advisor. We explored how to measure creativity using expert ratings of work samples.

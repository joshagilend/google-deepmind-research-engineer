One of my buddies SI hit 1% on Leetcode rankings and started working at Google after that. He's worked at Google for four years in May 2024.

I worked at a startup acquired by Google X in 2014. In 2013, I wrote code, designed new product accessories, and produced a video with over 100,000 views on YouTube. The engineering team still works at Google today!

Hey Google

For three months I worked with Cloudflare's developer platform every day. I used Cloudflare to host a private cloud, including images, videos, and files hosted on Cloudflare's lightning fast developer platform.

## Here's what I learned:

### Cloudflare Images

Cloudflare has great features for a solo developer. Prices were reasonable, no overages, and everything worked the first time.

I enjoyed that the Images featue was so simple: drag and drop, browse files, and then copy a public link. Here's an example of a public Cloudflare Image link: https://imagedelivery.net/X_BN-JDDL4T5Dab7aNGUKA/c5db2ea6-9a2c-444b-4e39-fcaff24d3a00/public

Here's the link rendered in Markdown: ![Cloudflare Image example](https://imagedelivery.net/X_BN-JDDL4T5Dab7aNGUKA/c5db2ea6-9a2c-444b-4e39-fcaff24d3a00/public)

### Cloudflare Video

Here's another feature that I wish I had time to use: Video hosting on Cloudflare. Cloudflare's Stream platform allowed me to host video in a private cloud. I could embed the video into any page, just like YouTube.

Here's a link to a fun Google video, hosted on Cloudflare's cloud.

### Cloudflare Bucket

Cloudflare Buckets or "R2" were great for hosting files. After so many websites banning ZIPs and file sharing (Gmail and Facebook Messenger, looking at you ðŸ‘€), it was pleasant and useful to quickly upload files, get a public link on my domains, and share instantly.

I uploaded a file to R2, and now it's hosted at this link: [https://bucket.agilend.tech/registry.yaml](https://bucket.agilend.tech/registry.yaml)

### Price

Cloudflare's cloud was virtually free. It was great to use and learn about media cloud hosting in a fun and creative way. Thanks Cloudflare for [a great set of demos](https://github.com/joshagilend/google-deepmind-research-engineer/blob/659842f6afcf151eab0b85420df8571fa5922d61/apps/spotify-notification.html)!

Career development question: ✋ People tend to ask themselves is if they have enough technical experience for a role. Here's what we found in one study: 📖 “In the Google context, we’d always believed that to be a manager ... you need to be as deep or deeper a technical expert than the people who work for you. It turns out that that’s absolutely the least important thing.” This came from one of my favorite Google projects: an internal study of thousands of employees and hundred of individual data points on each to understand what made for great managers and, from an employee perspective, who were the people you really wanted to work for. We found eight behaviors that found mattered: 1. Be a good coach. 2. Empower the team and don't micromanage. 3. Express interest for team members' success and personal well-being. 4. Be productive and results-oriented. 5. Be a good communicator. 6. Help with career development. 7. Have a vision. 8. Use your technical skills to advise. See that last one? While still important, it's surprisingly dead-last relative to other things. 😯 To measure these, here are the questions we ask employees, or you might ask yourself about your boss. My manager... 1. gives me actionable feedback that helps me improve my performance 2. does not "micromanage" (i.e. get involved in details that should be handled at other levels) 3. shows consideration for me as a person 4. keeps the team focused on our priority results & deliverables 5. regularly shared relevant information from his/her manager and senior leadership 6. has had a meaningful discussion with me about my career development in the past six months 7. communicates clear goals for our team 8. has the technical expertise (e.g. coding in Tech, accounting in Finance) required to effectively manage me And finally... 9. I would recommend my manager to other Googlers. So, keep this in mind when you're investing your time to become a better manager for your team or a more competitive candidate. Technical experience is only a small dimension of your much larger story. Curious to read more about these studies?

Cloud FinOps Cost Optimization Leader @ Google Cloud, Ex-AWSCloud FinOps Cost Optimization Leader @ Google Cloud, Ex-AWS
Celebrating 5 years at Google! 🎉 A few things I have learned along the way... 1️⃣ Its ok not to have a grand plan, or even a plan! I joined as a TAM and became interested in helping customers optimizing their costs and value on cloud. It all started as a 20% project, and now that 20% has turned into full time role, a global FinOps practice, and I love the opportunity to lead and work with the most amazing customers in the cloud, solving the most challenging problems of FinOps. Embrace the unknown it can lead to unexpected opportunities! Thanks to Justin, Eric, Bruce, Daniel, Marcus, Brad, Divya, Steve, Ben, Sara, Lee, Patrick, Kristin and many more that I am probably forgetting. 2️⃣ Don't hesitate to ask for help - its a strength, not a weakness. Week 1 into Google, and I was asked to deal with an escalation that went all the way to TK (Google Cloud CEO). It was a big outage and my customer was impacted. I was nervous and had no idea what to do, heck this is my first week in! I had to ask for help, Aaron creatively said lets go onsite and bring some donuts for customers. While the donuts didn't help as the outage went on for hours but it was customer empathy of the highest order. I learned its all about an attitude, nobody has it all figured out. Remember "All is well" as so famously quoted in 3 Idiots. (My non-Indian friends, if you have not seen that movie, go watch now. I guarantee you will love it!). Over the years I have not stopped asking for help. 3️⃣ Always be Googley (aka helpful!) Be helpful to others just because... and leave things better than there are. I LIVE by these principles and it has served me well! I take immense proud in knowing that 15+ Googlers have been promoted multiple times when we were engaged in the initiative that was highlighted in their performance reviews and I was asked for the promo feedback. Best yet, I made new deep connections and friends at work. I learned this from other Googlers who went out of the way to help me, sometime even when I couldn't gather the courage to ask! I am grateful for the journey so far and cheers to 5 more, this wouldn't be possible without the true cheerleaders, aka "roots", my family, friends and partner Kejul. (Roots reference is from Sahil's newsletter who I have been following for a year now in advancing my mindset -> https://lnkd.in/d-VYMd_m) OMG, I just saw these pictures from 5 years ago! Did I really have my mouth open the whole time? 😂 Life At Google #lifeatgoogle #5yearsgoogleversary #careers

Thrilled to share that I've officially graduated with my Master of Science in Communications! 🎉 If you asked me a year ago if I would have the opportunity to work at one of the best companies in the world while pursuing my master's with a full academic scholarship, I would have sat there in disbelief. I remember preparing for graduation as an undergraduate, telling myself, "Okay—we're really going to do this," "It will be worth it!" This journey has been one of the most rewarding and challenging experiences of my life. There were lots of nights after work where I questioned if I had made the right decision and told myself to just trust the process. I'm incredibly grateful for the unwavering support of my amazing friends and family, Denise M. Miranda, Esq. and Darryl Selsey, who cheered me on every step of the way, many of whom told me to "just keep swimming." A huge shoutout to my brilliant academic mentors, Nadia Ward, Ph.D., Dr. Kamaro Abubakar, and Danielle Morgan Acosta, and the entire support system at Google. Juggling a full-time role at Google while pursuing my master's was no easy feat, but it's been an invaluable experience that has enriched both my personal and professional development. My story is a testament to my leadership team's commitment to my growth. Thank you, Zuri Godfrey,Gemma Craig, JoAnna C., and Kim Revels, for pouring into me and truly being my champions. Your guidance and encouragement have been instrumental in my success, and I'm so thankful for the opportunity to have learned and grown alongside such incredible minds. Here's to being 22 with a master's degree and lifelong learning! 🥂 🎓 #lifelonglearning #Google #lifeatGoogle #Googlecloud
